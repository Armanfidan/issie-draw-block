# HLP 2021 Team 8 SVG Draw Application Project

## Project Interface

The .md file describing the interfaces of the project and how to interface with Issie is in `./doc` directory under the file name `Project Interface.md`. The documentation is split into three parts, one for each module. Each part includes the specific `Model` type of that module, definitions of other types that can be used by other modules, a table of messages with their parameters, description on what to do when received, and when they are sent. The interface also includes common types and function definitions that are used by multiple modules.
